You are a senior staff engineer building an MVP agentic add-on for landscaping/lawn care businesses.

Goal: Generate a working proof-of-concept web app that:
1) Ingests inbound events (missed call, inbound SMS, web lead) via webhooks
2) Orchestrates specialist agents (intake/qualify, quote, schedule, invoice follow-up, reviews)
3) Integrates with Twilio for SMS (required)
4) Uses a “mock FSM connector” abstraction (Jobber/Housecall Pro/Service Autopilot) for now, with clear interfaces and fake in-memory implementation
5) Provides a small admin UI for:
   - business profile setup
   - viewing conversations
   - approving actions (human-in-the-loop)
   - seeing ROI metrics

Tech constraints:
- Use TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js + Fastify (or Express if you strongly prefer)
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router) + minimal UI
- DB: SQLite with Prisma (simple + portable)
- Background jobs: BullMQ (Redis) OR a simple in-process queue for PoC (document how to swap)
- LLM: OpenAI-compatible client (do not hardcode keys; env vars)
- Use structured outputs (JSON schema / zod) for all agent responses

Architecture requirements:
- Event-driven orchestration: event -> supervisor -> plan -> tool calls -> state updates
- Strict separation:
  /agents (prompt + parsing + eval)
  /connectors (twilio, fsm mock, email optional)
  /orchestrator (supervisor, workflow runner)
  /policies (risk, tier permissions)
  /models (prisma schema)
  /ui (admin)

Deliverables:
- Full repository with:
  - README with setup instructions, env vars, and “run locally” steps
  - Prisma schema + migrations
  - Example seed data (a landscaping business profile)
  - Twilio webhook endpoints for inbound SMS and missed call event simulation
  - A “simulate event” endpoint for testing without Twilio
  - A minimal admin UI to see conversations + approve actions
  - Logging + audit trail

Also:
- Provide a minimal test plan and a few Jest tests covering orchestration and parsing.

Start by generating:
1) folder structure
2) package.json scripts
3) prisma schema
4) core types/interfaces
5) the orchestrator skeleton
Then fill in each agent and route one workflow end-to-end:
Missed call -> SMS outreach -> qualification -> propose schedule -> if approved -> create mock job.
