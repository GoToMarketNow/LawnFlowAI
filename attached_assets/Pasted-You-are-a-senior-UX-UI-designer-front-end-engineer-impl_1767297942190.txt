You are a senior UX/UI designer + front-end engineer implementing persistent, best-practice navigation for the LawnFlow web app.

GOAL
Add a persistent navigation system across the entire platform with two primary destinations:
1) Dashboard
2) My Profile

The navigation must be:
- Always accessible (persistent)
- Obvious and easy to find
- Mobile-friendly
- Consistent across all pages (including onboarding)
- Accessible (keyboard + ARIA)
- Minimal and clean (MVP-friendly)

STACK
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind (if present) or minimal CSS modules
- Existing pages include onboarding + admin/dashboard views

UX REQUIREMENTS (BEST PRACTICES)
1) Desktop layout:
- Left sidebar navigation for authenticated users
- App logo/name at top
- Primary nav links:
  - Dashboard
  - My Profile
- Secondary area (optional): Settings, Billing (can be placeholders)
- Active state highlight for current page
- Collapsible sidebar (optional MVP)

2) Mobile layout:
- Top app bar with:
  - hamburger menu (opens drawer)
  - app name/logo
  - profile icon/avatar (taps to open My Profile)
- Drawer includes Dashboard + My Profile

3) Placement & discoverability:
- “Dashboard” is the home anchor and default landing after login
- “My Profile” is always accessible from:
  - primary nav link
  - avatar menu top-right (desktop) / top bar (mobile)

4) Information architecture:
- Dashboard: operational overview (usage, actions, queue, test event)
- My Profile: user details + company profile + service area + integrations + security
(You may create sub-sections but keep My Profile as a single top-level route.)

AUTH REQUIREMENTS
- Navigation only shows for authenticated users.
- During onboarding, show a simplified nav (Dashboard + My Profile), but gate Dashboard actions until onboarding complete.
- If user is unauthenticated, show no app nav.

ROUTING REQUIREMENTS
- /dashboard
- /profile (My Profile)
- Optionally:
  - /settings (placeholder)
  - /billing (placeholder)

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
1) Create a top-level authenticated layout:
- app/(authed)/layout.tsx OR similar route group
- This layout wraps all authenticated pages with the persistent nav
- Ensure onboarding routes also use this layout, but you can show a “Setup in progress” banner.

2) Build reusable UI components:
- <AppShell> (layout wrapper)
- <SidebarNav> (desktop)
- <TopBar> (mobile)
- <MobileDrawer> (mobile nav)
- <UserMenu> (avatar dropdown with “My Profile”, “Logout”)

3) Active link highlighting:
- Use Next.js usePathname() to apply active styles
- Active state must be visible and consistent

4) Accessibility:
- Nav has aria-label="Primary"
- Buttons have aria-expanded where relevant
- Tab navigation works
- Focus trap in mobile drawer
- ESC closes drawer

5) Visual design guidelines (MVP):
- Use simple icon + label for nav items
- Keep spacing generous
- Avoid clutter
- Make “Dashboard” first, “My Profile” second
- Use a subtle but clear active indicator (left border or background)

COPY (microcopy)
- Use “Dashboard” label exactly
- Use “My Profile” label exactly
- User menu label: “Account”
- Add optional helper text in onboarding: “Setup in progress”

DELIVERABLES
- File-by-file code changes with paths
- Add layout wrapper and ensure all pages under authenticated app use it
- Create /dashboard and /profile routes (or refactor existing)
- Add nav components, responsive behavior, and active states
- Add minimal styling and ensure it looks good on desktop and mobile
- Add a short README note on structure and how to add new nav items later

OUTPUT FORMAT
Generate code file-by-file with paths and full content.

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER (DO THIS IN ORDER)
1) Identify current route structure and auth guard
2) Create authed layout wrapper (AppShell)
3) Build SidebarNav and TopBar (responsive)
4) Wire navigation into layout and wrap /dashboard and /profile
5) Add active state highlighting
6) Add avatar dropdown to access My Profile
7) Add mobile drawer and ensure accessibility
8) Test keyboard navigation and mobile responsiveness

IMPORTANT
- Keep the UI minimal and consistent with the existing app style
- Do not introduce heavy UI libraries unless already in use
- Do not break onboarding; just ensure nav persists with appropriate gating
