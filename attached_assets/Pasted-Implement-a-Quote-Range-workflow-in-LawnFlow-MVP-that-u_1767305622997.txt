Implement a Quote Range workflow in LawnFlow MVP that uses ZIP-first parcel coverage checks and customer validation fallback.

FEATURE GOAL
When a new service request arrives with an address + services requested, LawnFlow should:
1) Determine if parcel coverage exists for the property (using ZIP -> county -> coverage registry).
2) If coverage exists:
   - geocode address -> lat/lng
   - fetch parcel lot size sqft
   - map lot size to an area band
3) If coverage does not exist or parcel confidence is low:
   - ask customer for lot size band + complexity OR request photos
   - optionally propose site visit
4) Generate a quote range with assumptions and next step.

BACKEND TOOLS TO IMPLEMENT (can be mocked but must exist):
- geo.resolveCountyByZip(zip) -> { state, county_fips, county_name, confidence }
- geo.checkParcelCoverage(state, county_fips) -> { coverage: full|partial|none|unknown, provider, notes }
- geo.geocodeAddress(address) -> { lat, lng, normalized_address, zip }
- geo.fetchParcelByLatLng(lat,lng) -> { lot_area_sqft, parcel_id, confidence, source }
- quote.calculateRange(inputs) -> { low, high, line_items, confidence, assumptions } (rules-based)
- comms.sendSms(to, text) -> existing tool
- scheduling.proposeSiteVisit(...) -> existing or mocked

DATA MODELS
Add tables:
1) ParcelCoverageRegistry:
- state (string)
- countyFips (string)
- countyName (string)
- coverageStatus (full|partial|none|unknown)
- provider (string|null)
- lookupUrl (string|null)
- updatedAt

2) PropertyQuoteContext:
- leadId
- normalizedAddress
- zip
- countyName
- parcelCoverageStatus
- lotAreaSqft (nullable)
- areaBand
- source (parcel|customer|unknown)
- confidence (high|medium|low)
- notes

QUOTE CALCULATOR (rules-based MVP)
Inputs:
- services requested
- frequency
- area band
- complexity flags (trees/shrubs/beds/slope/access) default unknown
- business min prices + pricing rules

Implement:
- Convert area band -> base minutes per service
- Apply multipliers:
  trees/shrubs (1.0/1.15/1.35)
  beds/edges (1.0/1.1/1.25)
  slope (1.0/1.1/1.25)
  access (1.0/1.05/1.1)
  frequency (weekly 1.0, biweekly 1.2–1.35, monthly 1.6–2.2)
- Compute minutes low/high and price low/high with minimums
- Determine confidence:
  - high if parcel lot size present and services are standard
  - medium if customer band present
  - low if unknown area or high variance service (cleanup/mulch/shrubs) without photos

QUOTING AGENT PROMPTS
Add a Quoting Agent that:
- calls the geo tools in order (ZIP coverage -> parcel -> fallback)
- if fallback needed, asks max 3 questions OR requests photos
- produces quote range with assumptions and next step
- returns JSON validated via zod

CUSTOMER MESSAGING
If confidence high/medium:
- send a short range estimate and ask 1 confirmation question
If confidence low:
- send “range is broad” + ask for photos OR propose site visit
Always keep SMS under 320 characters.

HUMAN APPROVAL
- Always require human approval for sending fixed prices or booking.
- For range quotes in Starter tier, allow auto-send if within policy; otherwise request approval.

DELIVERABLES
- New geo service layer + mocked implementations
- Coverage registry seeded with a few sample counties (unknown by default)
- Quote calculator module + unit tests
- Quoting agent + zod schemas + tests
- Wiring into orchestrator: new inbound quote_request flow
- Minimal admin UI view to see quote context, assumptions, and approve/deny send
- README explaining how ZIP->county->coverage works and how to expand coverage over time
